    h2 Delete Row
    p This example shows how to implement a delete button that removes a table row upon completion. First let's look at the table body:
    hr
    table(class='table table-border delete-row-example')
        thead
            tr
                th Name
                th Email
                th Status
                th
        tbody(id='tbody' hx-confirm='are you sure?' hx-target='closest tr' hx-swap='outerHTML swap:1s')
            tr
                td Joe Smith 0
                td joe@smith.org
                td Active
                td
                    button(class='btn btn-danger' hx-delete='/delete-row/0') Delete
            tr
                td Joe Smith 1
                td joe@smith.org
                td Active
                td
                    button(class='btn btn-danger' hx-delete='/delete-row/1') Delete
            tr
                td Joe Smith 2
                td joe@smith.org
                td Active
                td
                    button(class='btn btn-danger' hx-delete='/delete-row/2') Delete
            tr
                td Joe Smith 3
                td joe@smith.org
                td Active
                td
                    button(class='btn btn-danger' hx-delete='/delete-row/3') Delete
